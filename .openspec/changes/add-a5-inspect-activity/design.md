## Context

See proposal.md for motivation. This crosses the Arkade adapter, Core state, public API, production UI, and Admin demonstration, so a design artifact is required. The installed SDK is 0.4.67. Existing uncommitted address/funding and achievement work is separate and must be preserved.

### Capability evidence

Read-only inspection of node_modules/@arkade-os/sdk/dist/chunk-AEWJU6NZ.js on 2026-09-03 established:

- getTransactionHistory() calls getBoardingTxs(); that method reads the wallet's boarding addresses, matches their outputs, and includes unconfirmed entries with RECEIVED direction, amount, boardingTxid, and createdAt equal to zero.
- notifyIncomingFunds() forwards matching onchain coins with txid, vout, value, and status.confirmed. It returns subscription cleanup.
- getBoardingUtxos() supplies a snapshot of unspent deposits including confirmation status. Use this for precise current incoming status rather than interpreting history.settled as Bitcoin confirmation: that history field reflects whether the boarding output was spent.
- The SDK's EsploraProvider owns explorer fetching and its watcher uses WebSocket with a polling fallback. Application code need not implement either transport.
- A live call through EsploraProvider.getTransactions() for the user-supplied public Signet address returned an unconfirmed matching output. This verifies SDK provider access, not an authenticated wallet's complete flow. No wallet secrets were accessed.

The live transaction differed from the earlier explorer snapshot. No cause (replacement, eviction, or otherwise) is established. Never hardcode either result or report a missing entry as confirmed.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:** A minimal copyable list of all transaction history Arkade supplies, newest first, including incoming, outgoing, confirmed, and spent entries, with truthful status, freshness, and cleanup.

**Non-Goals:** Reconstructing history unavailable from Arkade, a separate durable history store, settlement execution, initiating payments, a new provider integration, or treating incoming funds as spendable. Displaying past outgoing transactions is in scope.

## Decisions

1. **SDK-only boundary.** All reads and subscriptions go through the existing wallet and Arkade SDK in integration/arkade. The SDK's own configured onchain provider is allowed; direct application fetches to mempool or an alternative provider are not. If wallet-level support cannot satisfy the feature, stop implementation and report the limitation.
2. **Full SDK history plus notifications.** Establish subscription and reconcile an initial SDK history snapshot, buffering or reconciling concurrent notifications so existing records and arrivals during loading are both represented. Include all incoming and outgoing history exposed by the SDK, retaining confirmed and spent records. Retrieve all pages when the SDK exposes pagination; do not apply a client-side recent-only cap. The UTXO snapshot supplements status and outpoint metadata and never replaces the history source: a spent output can disappear from UTXOs while its history remains. Notifications trigger SDK reconciliation while Account Activity is open; a 15-second SDK reconciliation read also catches missed outgoing changes, removals, and stale connections. SDK Esplora forcePolling is used so subscription cleanup does not race a WebSocket error fallback. The built-in EsploraProvider points to https://mempool.space/signet/api to match the supplied explorer; the SDK default explorer returned different mempool observations despite an identical Signet tip. No application HTTP transport is introduced. Distinguish Pending, Confirmed for Bitcoin confirmation, SDK-supported offchain settlement status, and Status unavailable. Neither history.settled nor an offchain success alone proves Bitcoin confirmation or spendability. Use stable SDK composite transaction keys to reconcile history and supplemental coin data without duplicating amounts or collapsing distinct history records. If a pending record disappears from SDK history, reconcile it without inventing a reason or success; merely being spent is not a removal criterion.
3. **Small public contract and ordering.** Core exposes an Account Activity view route, load/retry behavior, and immutable activity state through the existing state/subscription surface. Normalize entries to a stable ID, available transaction/output identifiers, amountSats, Incoming/Outgoing direction, supported status, and ordering metadata; do not export Arkade types or recovery material. Sort timestamped records newest first, with a stable SDK-order tie break. Pending entries lacking transaction timestamps appear first; preserve SDK order within that group. Other entries without usable timestamps follow dated entries in SDK order. Do not turn epoch-zero timestamps or fetch time into invented transaction dates. Account generations and request generations reject stale reads and callbacks.
4. **Transaction rows, details, and Copy-all.** Preserve the delivered Transactions route below Balance, Account ID, three-line rows, single-click detail opening, selection on Back, and fixed 480px host-capped dialogs with internal scrolling. The detail report retains its own Copy. Copy all transactions exports every current row in order using formatTransactions: one logical line with full identifiers, exact asset data, amount/direction and full supported status. It is disabled while loading or empty, and only reports success after the clipboard resolves. Failure exposes the complete export as selectable read-only text with retry. Later Pending Operation Dialog decisions supersede the initial inline loader: allow 75 seconds per initial-read attempt and one automatic retry; exhausted foreground failure shows error/OK and closes the source page. Partial available records remain explicitly labeled when full history cannot refresh. A4 remains the authority for balances.
5. **Bounded lifecycle.** Returning to Account, closing, logout, account replacement/reset, and disposal stop activity subscriptions and clear transient activity. Returning to Activity performs a fresh read. No activity persistence or background monitoring is introduced.
6. **One production implementation.** Admin adds Account / Inspect Activity and opens the ordinary Account flow using public API. A logged-out user sees the existing chooser; no account or transaction is manufactured. User stories retain A5.01-A5.06; workflow-record aggregation remains deferred.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- SDK subscription startup can catch onchain errors internally -> inspect connection health and verify failure behavior; successful subscription return alone is not proof of live monitoring.
- SDK history and UTXO status have different meanings and coverage -> show every SDK history record, use UTXOs only as supplemental evidence, retain spent history, and state that completeness is limited to what Arkade supplies.
- Pending or older SDK records may lack a usable timestamp or output index -> use the explicit ordering fallback and available identifiers; never fabricate chronology or outpoints.
- Replacement, duplicates, and concurrent snapshots -> reconcile by stable keys; never append duplicate notifications or infer confirmation from disappearance.
- Signet timing is external -> keep live wallet confirmation/notification evidence pending until observed; fixtures prove deterministic behavior only.
- Parallel address/achievement changes modify shared menus/specs -> reconcile their delivered state at implementation and spec sync; do not overwrite their requirements with the older main-spec baseline.

## Migration Plan

No persistence migration or new dependency. First verify the active-wallet SDK path, then implement adapter/Core/UI and the Admin demonstration. Run targeted tests and real-browser checks with SDK-only traffic. Delivery can be withheld if capability verification fails; rollback, if needed, is an additive change removing the new route without discarding unrelated work.
