# Blockchain Integration Service

**WIP** — reusable BTC Lightning integration for browser games. The first React demo provides a split-screen admin and portrait runtime preview.

## Live Demo

[Open the live demo](https://samuelasherrivello.github.io/blockchain-integration-service/)

Current release: **v0.10.0**. Open the link without query parameters: the split-screen admin and 9:16 runtime preview appear. GitHub Actions runs plain `npm run build` and publishes `packages/integration-demo/dist`.

In the current local implementation, Account / Account Button demonstrates entry and Account / Create Account opens the real Signet creation flow. Continue remembers the new account across refreshes and browser restarts. The logged-in dialogue shows enabled Log Out and working Back. Reset Client is implemented as a first-run reset; its real stored-data check remains manual. A3 Restore Account supports a hidden twelve-word grid, Show checkbox, clipboard paste, word/checksum validation, and Signet-gated persistent restoration. The full account menu, payments, and achievements remain unavailable. A6 logout is implemented with manual storage verification pending. The deployed release may lag the local checkout.

## Getting Started

Read the [project brief](documentation/BGS_PROJECT_BRIEF.md) and [design discussion](documentation/design-discussion.md). With Node.js 24 or newer installed, run `npm ci`, then `npm run dev`. Open the printed localhost URL. The host HTML is `packages/integration-demo/index.html`; serve it through Vite rather than opening the source as a file URL.

### Release Workflow

1. Run `npm ci` and `npm run build` to check types and build both workspaces.
2. Commit and push to `main`; **Deploy live demo** builds the integration package and publishes `packages/integration-demo/dist/` through GitHub Actions.
3. Check the [workflow](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/blockchain-integration-service/actions/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) and live site. Manual redeployment is also available.

| 2 | Specs | `openspec list --specs` | List agreed specifications. |
| 3 | Setup | `./.openspec/setup.ps1` | Install all workflows locally. |

| 6 | Preview | `npm run preview` | Serve the production demo locally. |

## Project Overview

Signet-only, Arkade-only integration with no custom application server. The separate game remains playable without an account. Real transaction outcomes only.

### Documentation

- [Brief](documentation/BGS_PROJECT_BRIEF.md): original BGS design baseline.
- [Design discussion](documentation/design-discussion.md): pending architecture and naming decisions.

### Configuration

React 19.2.8 + TypeScript, npm workspaces, and Vite. React was verified against the npm latest tag when this slice was created. The official Arkade SDK (`@arkade-os/sdk` 0.4.67) creates genuine Signet wallets in `packages/integration`. The integration owns encrypted browser persistence; recovery material never enters public state or events. No payments or funding run.

### Dependencies

| Package | Role | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| React + React DOM | Runtime UI | 19.2.8 |
| Arkade SDK | Future Signet adapter; currently unused | 0.4.67 |
| TypeScript | Type checking | 7.0.2 |
| Vite | Dev server and production builds | 8.2.2 |

The root `package.json` defines npm workspaces and shared tooling. Each package has its own manifest. `package-lock.json` locks the complete dependency tree; `npm ci` installs it locally. `.gitignore` excludes all `node_modules/` and `dist/` directories.

### Structure

- `packages/integration/src/`: public entry point, production UI, and reserved core/Arkade boundaries.
- `packages/integration-demo/src/`: admin panel, portrait preview, and split-screen composition.
- `documentation/`: brief and decisions.
- `.openspec/`: specification configuration.
- `.agents/skills/`: OpenSpec workflows.

The demo imports the integration package through its public exports. The runtime UI does not depend on the demo. On narrow screens, the admin and preview stack vertically.

## Project Details

### OpenSpec

All core and optional workflows from [OpenSpec profiles](https://openspec.dev/docs/profiles) are installed as Codex skills. Invoke with `$openspec-...`.

With OpenSpec CLI installed, run `./.openspec/setup.ps1` using PowerShell 7 after checkout. It creates an ignored local `openspec` compatibility link to `.openspec/`, because OpenSpec 1.11 expects the original directory name. Files are tracked only under `.openspec/`; the link is recreated on each machine. Run CLI commands from the repository root.

[Grill Me](.agents/skills/open-spec-grill-me/SKILL.md) is optional and user-invoked with `$open-spec-grill-me`. Use it before a proposal to clarify the idea, or afterward to refine planning artifacts. It is not a schema prerequisite and never starts implementation.

| # | Name | Skill | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Explore | `$openspec-explore` | Discuss ideas. |
| 2 | Propose | `$openspec-propose` | Draft a change. |
| 3 | Apply | `$openspec-apply-change` | Implement agreed tasks. |
| 4 | Update | `$openspec-update-change` | Revise planning artifacts. |
| 5 | Sync | `$openspec-sync-specs` | Update main specs. |
| 6 | Archive | `$openspec-archive-change` | Archive completed work. |
| 7 | New | `$openspec-new-change` | Scaffold a change. |
| 8 | Continue | `$openspec-continue-change` | Create the next artifact. |
| 9 | Fast-forward | `$openspec-ff-change` | Generate planning artifacts. |
| 10 | Verify | `$openspec-verify-change` | Check implementation. |
| 11 | Bulk archive | `$openspec-bulk-archive-change` | Archive multiple changes. |
| 12 | Onboard | `$openspec-onboard` | Guided workflow. |

## Troubleshooting

If publishing fails, inspect the Actions run. Pages source must be **GitHub Actions**. The local Account demo supports creation and account-access restoration; the full active-profile menu remains planned. If the local port is busy, use the URL printed by Vite.
