# Layout and future game integration

The starter implements a React browser surface, centered ratio-preserving viewport, Babylon Lite 2D content, external gutters, and UI corners. The default content is a WebGPU-rendered pixel-art showcase, not gameplay. New app and game concepts choose portrait or landscape, never square. The template demo can switch between landscape and portrait; when adapting it into a project, choose one orientation, keep the corresponding template viewport display, and remove the orientation toggle, shortcut, and saved override. The viewport is the primary content area in both windowed and fullscreen modes. The gutter layout is required, but adding secondary content there (for example, instructions or backstory) is optional.

## Implemented configuration

Edit `project-name/src/ui/layout.js` for defaults. Positive finite `width` and `height` define a ratio, not a game resolution. The layout validator supports square ratios for general use, but new app and game concepts select portrait (width < height) or landscape (width > height). `gutterBackground` sets the outside background. Invalid configuration displays an actionable alert.

`App` accepts `layout`, `content` (React elements), and `gutters` with optional `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` React elements. Supply these in `project-name/src/main.jsx`. Generic content can scroll internally under the UI. Gutters occupy residual space only, scroll internally, and collapse to zero without shrinking the viewport. For games, choose whether and how game content scrolls to suit the design. Corners keep title, links, settings, and version roles; bounded scroll regions and adaptive insets keep controls reachable at small sizes.

The page structure allows the complete HUD to remain inside the viewport and visible during fullscreen. Gutters are not visible in fullscreen. Custom UI in a gutter is acceptable only as secondary UI; all primary UI must be implemented in React within the viewport.

The corner spacing is controlled by the `--viewport-padding` CSS variable in `project-name/src/ui/style.css` (10px by default). The responsive inset caps this value on very small viewports.

```jsx
<App
  layout={{ orientation: "portrait", width: 9, height: 16, gutterBackground: "#f0f0f0" }}
  content={<main>Your responsive app content</main>}
  gutters={{ left: <aside>Optional gutter content</aside> }}
/>
```

## Implemented renderer policies and lifecycle

Edit `project-name/src/content/babylon/config.js` to change the developer-selected renderer and content style. It defaults to Babylon Lite + 2D; no runtime mode picker is added. Every 2D game uses Pixel Perfect. This policy does not force the game's logical resolution or render scale; choose both for the game. Selecting 3D does not apply the 2D policy and does not create a scene: implement the requested 3D game scene and its renderer setup using the separate Performance-scaled 3D guidance below. This template does not include a 3D showcase scene. Babylon Lite requires WebGPU. Do not add a fallback renderer; show a clear unsupported-browser message when WebGPU is unavailable or initialization fails.

### Game content and audio choices

Replace the included Babylon pixel-art showcase with the requested game's content. It demonstrates renderer integration only and is not a game scene or required gameplay. Each game has full freedom to choose its logical resolution, render scale, and whether and how content scrolls.

Sound is optional, and music is not recommended. When sound is included, recommend 4 to 10 sound effects tied to game events. Provide a UI mute toggle and a documented URL argument that mutes all sound, so AI testing can run silently while human players can enable sound in the normal experience.

## Keyboard input ownership

The React UI layer must not assign shortcuts or otherwise capture **WASD, the four Arrow keys, Spacebar, or Enter**. Keep these keys available for the content layer, which may use them for game controls when needed. Choose other keys for React UI shortcuts and display their assigned keys in the UI.

“Pixel Perfect” is this template's name for a configuration that keeps authored pixels sharp; it is not a Babylon Lite mode or API. The 2D preset is implemented in `project-name/src/content/` using Babylon Lite 1.32.0's native SpriteRenderer APIs.

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Responsive smooth | Future option for non-game integrations: match viewport CSS presentation size and choose backing resolution and filtering for smooth content. 2D games use Pixel Perfect. |
| Pixel Perfect (required for 2D games) | The showcase uses a 320x180 logical stage with centered integer logical-to-CSS scaling when it fits; it samples the imported 32x32 tile with nearest minification and magnification, disables mipmaps and MSAA, and keeps the canvas backing DPR-aware. A game chooses its own logical resolution and render scale. |
| Performance-scaled 3D | Separate policy: choose perspective or orthographic projection; use fixed or dynamic internal resolution scaling with explicit bounds and a performance target. Keep UI at independent CSS resolution. The 2D Pixel Perfect policy does not apply to 3D. |

The included Pixel Perfect showcase has a white background and an original 32x32 PNG at `project-name/src/content/babylon/images/concentric-squares-32.png`, made from concentric black and gray squares. Its native texels contain only hard black/gray boundaries; rotation reveals deliberate stair-step edges. The sprite is 32x32 logical world units and stays centered at the world origin. Its projected raster footprint changes with render resolution while its world size and center stay fixed. A React UI label sits in the lower-center target area: `(B) Babylon Lite` uses the existing corner-title style, while `Render Scale: <relative scale>x` and `Mode: 2DPixelPerfect` use corner-body. Render Scale is relative to the native backing resolution: Quarter is 0.25x, Half is 0.5x, Native is 1x, and Double is 2x. It is separate from the logical-to-CSS fit scale. The label uses the supplied `#e0694b` accent. Clicking `(B)` or pressing B opens a React dialog repeating the same settings. While open, the Babylon content surface has a 5-CSS-pixel `#e0694b` DOM outline; closing the dialog or pressing Escape removes it. The Babylon Lite render loop, including sprite animation processing, pauses while any Config, Stats, or Babylon Lite dialog is open and resumes when all are closed. Resize/DPR changes update the backing-pixel geometry.

Babylon Lite owns native canvas backing sizing: its surface sets the buffer to `clientWidth/clientHeight × devicePixelRatio` (clamped only if explicitly configured). The integration leaves the default full DPR enabled and never writes DPR-scaled values into `canvas.width` or `canvas.height`. The internal render target is independently sized from that native backing size. Sprite positions and sizes are in logical world coordinates, while the Sprite2D view zoom maps those coordinates into the selected target; presentation then samples the target into the native backing canvas.

For Pixel Perfect, use Babylon Lite's `loadTexture2D` with `minFilter: "nearest"`, `magFilter: "nearest"`, `mipMaps: false`, and clamp-to-edge addressing. Create the engine with `msaaSamples: 1`; Babylon Lite's pure-2D SpriteRenderer also renders its swapchain pass at one sample. The canvas uses CSS `image-rendering: pixelated` to avoid browser smoothing if it is resampled. DPR is applied once to the backing buffer. The guarantee is crisp logical-to-CSS presentation, not universal physical-pixel alignment: fractional DPR and browser compositing can affect physical display alignment. If integer scaling cannot fit, the stage uses a positive fractional fit and suspends strict pixel-alignment guarantees. A 3D project follows its own quality and performance policy instead of inheriting the Pixel Perfect defaults.

Babylon Lite requires WebGPU. If WebGPU is unavailable or engine initialization fails, the content layer shows a clear message that the Babylon Lite experience requires WebGPU; the surrounding React app remains mounted and usable. The integration uses Lite-native settings and APIs rather than Babylon.js constants. Pin and check the installed Lite version's declarations when changing engine options. Content configuration, renderer setup, the showcase asset, and lifecycle code belong under `project-name/src/content/`; reusable React UI remains under `project-name/src/ui/`.

Document overrides beside presets, including incompatibilities. Texture filtering, mipmaps, camera projection, canvas backing sizing, and anti-aliasing are renderer decisions that must implement the selected policy.

`Content.jsx` owns asynchronous engine setup and cleanup. It loads the tile texture, creates the nearest-sampled centered sprite layer, registers the renderer, and calls `startEngine`; Babylon Lite owns the render loop and automatically tracks canvas client size and DPR. A ResizeObserver updates the centered sprite when the viewport changes. React dialog state controls a 5 CSS pixel orange outline around the Babylon content surface, rendered as a DOM overlay so it remains visible while Babylon processing is paused. DPR-change listeners are removed on cleanup. Renderer disposal releases its resources and caller-owned atlases/textures before the engine is disposed. StrictMode remounts cancel initialization safely and clean up stale listeners and bindings. Camera, filtering, mipmap, and MSAA options must be verified against the pinned Lite release.

## Five resolution terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CSS size | Layout dimensions in CSS pixels; never multiply by DPR. |
| Logical resolution | Designed game coordinate dimensions, independent of display density. |
| Internal render resolution | Renderer output target, possibly reduced for performance. |
| Canvas backing resolution | Actual canvas buffer width and height. |
| Display size | CSS rectangle presenting the output. |

### Babylon Lite render-resolution control

The Babylon Lite HUD's `(R) RenderResolution` setting cycles `Quarter → Half → Native → Double` and persists in React local storage. RenderResolution is the authoritative setting for the internal target dimensions. The default is Native. The presets scale each native backing-buffer dimension by 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2; Double is uniformly capped at the active WebGPU `maxTextureDimension2D` limit. The React HUD and Babylon Lite dialog report the actual selected texture dimensions, including any cap.

For template users choosing an art direction, these presets are visual shorthand: 0.25x suggests an 8-bit look, 0.5x a 16-bit look, 1x a modern look, and 2x a super-smooth modern look. These are style cues rather than guarantees; the artwork and game design determine the final impression.

The logical view and CSS viewport remain unchanged. In 2D Pixel Perfect mode, Render Scale is derived from the authoritative RenderResolution: it is 0.25x for Quarter, 0.5x for Half, 1x for Native, and 2x for Double (or the actual ratio when a device limit caps the upscale). The Sprite2D view adjusts its world-to-target zoom to compensate for each target size, so the logical scene keeps the same on-screen size and framing as RenderResolution changes. The centered Sprite2D layer view keeps its camera focus at world origin `(0, 0)`, and the spinning showcase title itself remains positioned at `(0, 0)`; its center does not move. Babylon Lite renders the scene into a same-format intermediate texture whose minification and magnification filters are both `nearest`, then presents that texture to the native-size canvas. The sampling density changes while the projected screen size stays consistent, intentionally retaining hard, jagged pixel-art edges. MSAA remains disabled. Source textures use nearest sampling and no mipmaps; the render target is not compressed because WebGPU render-attachment textures must remain directly renderable.

The adapter for Babylon Lite 1.32's SpriteRenderer uses a surface-shaped view with the target texture dimensions while sharing the engine's device and render-context registry. Recheck this behavior against Lite declarations and renderer internals when upgrading the pinned version. A render-target failure reports a Babylon initialization error and does not select another renderer.

Define the mapping among these sizes. DPR informs backing decisions once; if the engine applies DPR, do not multiply it again. Reduced internal output can be composited into a larger backing buffer or use a reduced backing buffer directly; state which mapping is used. React UI retains CSS resolution regardless of logical or reduced game rendering dimensions.

## Integer scaling and letterboxing

Declare positive finite logical dimensions or derive them as tile width/height times grid columns/rows. Tile/grid values must be positive and grid counts integral. If explicit and derived dimensions are both supplied, require agreement.

Automatic integer scale is `floor(min(Vw/Lw,Vh/Lh))`. When it is at least 1, center display size `Lw*scale,Lh*scale` without stretching using an internal letterbox background. Explicit scales must be positive integers; an oversized request must use a documented fallback or actionable error.

Example: 32x32 logical-pixel tiles in a 10x18 grid yield 320x576 logical resolution. A 640x1152 CSS viewport fits scale 2. An 800x1200 viewport also fits scale 2, with centered 640x1152 display and internal letterboxing of 80 CSS pixels per side and 24 above/below.

When the automatic integer result is zero, the proposed default is positive fractional fit `min(Vw/Lw,Vh/Lh)` with pixel-perfect guarantees suspended. For 160x288 available space and 320x576 logical content, scale is 0.5 and display is 160x288. Never produce a zero-size surface for positive available space. Consumers may explicitly override with 1x clipping or scrolling, documenting visibility/input trade-offs.

Browser gutters are outside the viewport; game letterboxing is inside it. Pixel alignment concerns camera origin, sprite vertices, and presentation origin. Integer scaling guarantees concern logical-to-CSS pixels. Physical display guarantees additionally depend on DPR, backing mapping, filtering, and compositing; fractional DPR prevents a universal physical pixel promise.

Browser zoom is an intended presentation change. It can resize the available CSS viewport and change DPR, so React's CSS layout and the displayed game can appear larger or smaller. The game keeps its chosen logical resolution, visible world bounds, and camera framing; zoom alone does not redefine its game coordinates. Recalculate native backing dimensions from the current CSS content size and DPR, then derive the selected internal render target from that backing size. Because browser zoom can shrink CSS dimensions while increasing DPR (or the reverse), their product—and therefore the Native render target—may remain nearly constant. That is expected; do not force the render target or logical view to change just to make its readout visibly differ after zoom.

## Implemented and future development diagnostics

The showcase label reports the active render scale relative to Native; it is independent of the logical-to-CSS fit scale. Opening its React dialog outlines the Babylon Lite content-world boundary in `#e0694b`. A full diagnostics panel may additionally report CSS/client size, DPR, logical/internal/backing/display dimensions, and scale bounds. Validate pointer conversion independently of reduced render resolution and exercise resize, fullscreen, zoom, fractional DPR, and fallback.

## Local verification

Run `npm ci`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` from the repository root. Start `npm run dev` and open Vite's URL. The focused test suite covers the layout contract; separate existing skill-test failures may still be reported by the full suite.
## Conceptual layout and parameter tree

Content extends beneath the UI; diagram spacing is illustrative. Shared and App parameters are implemented; Game parameters are future responsibilities.
